Another time, while the final movie was playing for the evening, three staff members watched as a roll of paper towels hanging on the wall in the concession stand, rapidly started to unravel onto the floor. One employee put his hand out to stop it. It stopped until he removed his hand, and then it started up again. Employees and patrons reported that when they would walk into the men’s room, they would sense that something was there. It would be a weird electrical vibration, as if you were to accidentally shock yourself while plugging something in. It’s only mild and it just seems to flood the ro om from ceiling to floor. One evening after closing, there was a report of toilets flushing and sinks turning on at full blast. In the projection room at the very top of the balcony, there was a crawlspace with a ladder that led to a lower level of the roof, right above the marquee.

In time, the family soon built a large house near a deep, narrow canyon. The man's daughters despised the young, soon-to-be mother and wife, for the way she had treated them. Launa wanted their father all to herself. So on the night before her wedding, in order for her to get their father, Launa murdered the two young girls. She hid the murdered children in the house. When she regained her sanity later that night, she came back screaming and moaning through the canyon, begging for forgiveness for the sickening killings.

This building is definitely haunted; witnesses have heard noises from the upper floor and seen lights near the fountain at night. It has tunnels that lead from Northwestern part of town to the Southeastern side of town, which ends up at the airport; they have all been caved in. It has been a place for teenagers to go and party. Different people have experienced something in what they call the \"Alter Room\". It is a shadowy figure that lurks just inside the doorway. There is also a cemetery just to the north of the building, graves disturbed and a large cross has been cut down. Town legend says that the teenagers that cut it down in the 70's all died that year. The houses around the area are also reported to have paranormal activities. The Holy Cross in recent days has become a dangerous place to be. Murders have been committed there in the last few years. A gang has killed a peer as a sacrifice and a lover’s quarrel was the demise of a man in a drainpipe. The place has always been that of graffiti artists writing their names or the names of their favorite bands. Now gang names and signs are all over it marking it as territory.

In fact, up in the Brigham City Valley, there is a \"B\" on the Mountain for Box Elder and though faded, the \"I\" is still present as well. the school also served as a Hospital for wounded soldiers during WWII. As a precautionary measure there were many underground tunnels that were built to support the likes of an evacuation. Today many of the buildings have been remade into apartment housing and also are rented out as storage, but some are still closed to the public and are not being used for anything. The tunnels were boarded up at the end of the war. Today the buildings not in use stand deserted and boarded up. Kids from the area go inside sort of like a dare. Upon one of these instances it was discovered that the tunnels that were once boarded up now stand open to those daring enough to go inside. One of the rooms you can get to by use of the tunnels has been used for satanic rituals. Blood hangs on the walls; there is a pot in the corner and an \"alter\" in the middle of the room. Another room has paintings of demonic clowns with knives and other sharp objects painted on the walls. there have been speakers and lecturers brought in to speak on the subject at the college. One speaker said that Northern Utah was 2nd in the nation among Satan worshiping among teenagers. It is verified by police there is some sort of human activity and they warn not to go up there. April addition - there are an enormous amount of cold spots located in both buildings. one hallwaya rececent explorer walked down was almost completly undamaged with grafeti, but apon their second travel down the same hallway all of the sheetrock on the walls had been ripped off and throne onto the floor, they are positive that it was the same hallway.",

It stands at 10,000ft. elevation in a valley of the San Jaun Mountain Range in Southern Colorado. There is much history at the lodge and in the Platoro area in general. Platoro was founded in the early 1880's to provide housing, food and even a post office for local gold/silver miners. One of the ghosts that haunt the area/lodge is believed to be 'Little Eva'. Eva was a 16yr. old prostitute that was shot by the wife of a local miner. Her grave is an unmarked concrete slab that's in a field about 150yrds from the lodge.­ - (private property)­ - Another 'Spirit' is believed to be Henry, the ghost of a man that passed away(1950's) inside the main lodge after suffering a heart attack while hunting. Some of the mysterious things that happen are; Shadows(silhouettes)passing by/behind people when they're alone. Bowls, silverware, plates getting thrown off counters and shelves. Doors opening/shutting, even locking on there own. Numerous cold spots that are almost always there. The sound of furniture being dragged across upper floors when no one's around.

The story goes that one time in the fall of 1894, when the train stopped, a small child named Annabell got off the train to walk in the woods awhile with her brother. When the train started up she was no where to be found. Her parents and brother got off the train to look for the girl. They stayed for days, and even with the help of the County Sheriff and local ranchers on horseback, she was never found. On several occasions during the autumn while the train was still running, engineers and conductors have thought that they saw a small child playing in the woods. In later years on many occasions, boy scouts and scout leaders camping in the area during the fall have heard a small voice singing in the dense aspen groves directly to the east of the old abandoned railroad bed.",

It seems they had been sent by the South to intercept a gold shipment and take it back to Texas. They were successful in stealing the gold shipment on a wagon and had almost crossed Poncha Pass when they ran into a Union patrol form Ft Garland. A small skirmish ensued where three rebels were killed and most of the gold was retaken. Two soldiers that were wounded carried off one of the four wooden crates of gold and ran to the south up little Pemmican Creek where they disappeared for all time. Some say they left the area, and some have said they died in the dense woods and aspen groves from their wounds. The Union patrol searched for many days but could not find any trace of them. The three Southern soldiers who had been killed are buried in the Poncha Springs Little Round Top Cemetery. Local ranchers and miners have reported seeing a old man in tattered grey uniform feebly asking for help, but when they would go to help him, they could never find him. Motorists along this stretch of Hwy 285 have seen a older man in tattered clothes saluting as they passed. The sheriff was called on several occasions to investigate, but no one was ever found.

   "description": "Riverdale Road is a circuitous and meandering stretch of poorly maintained country road running primarily from northeast Denver then north to Highway 7 in Brighton. The road is within a distinctly rural area currently and derives its name from its parallel relationship to the South Platte River. Between the road and the west riverbank is a dense alluvial soil which is rich and fertile which attributes a long history to the road. The area was not farmed in the traditional sense until the late 1880's and there was never any official form of slavery on any of these farms, yet there is a definite sense of the arcane and tragic. Unlike the officially platted roads of the Colorado highway system, Riverdale is very curvy and follows the bank of the South Platte, belying its original usage as a section of the so-called Trapper, or Cherokee Trail, used by the indigenous inhabitants of the area for nearly 1500 years before contact with the Europeans in 1817. Little is known about the place during this time. What is well documented is the time period from 1880-1950's when the area was part of the large truck farm complex, primarily of Sugar Beets. The harvesting of the Beets would occur during the fall and was done by abjectly poor eastern European immigrants who worked the Smelters the remainder of the year. As a result the farms were notorious for their abuses of the migrant workers to the point of near slavery, a tragedy which continues today. This, along with the many pioneers and such who died traveling Cherokee trail has riddled it with angry and unpleasant spirit activity. In addition to the aforementioned legend there is a place, some miles south of Highway seven and near to the northernmost end of the road which is distinctly hilly, uncommonly so. The hills are some 300' in height and uniform in shape. These hills surround a large building and a residence known to local teenagers as the \"gates of hell\". The legend which surrounds this place is that some time in the early 1980's a bizarre and abusive religious cult was cloistered there where they would commit unknown heresies, including the death of a child. To this day it is said, that at certain times, a number of phantom dogs can be seen guarding the driveway and have even gone so far as to chase some people into their cars, a point at which, they disappear without a trace.",

Finally, on the northern-most part of the field is another building, which was part of the other two, which has since been remodeled into the local school districts office. The point behind all of this, is that these buildings were once used as offices, dormitory's and also a TB hospital and sanitarium by the U.S. Calvary during the early settlement days. This area was called \"Ft. Lapwai\". The building has now been remodeled-extensively- and contains a total of 11 head start classes, with 4 of those classes for the ages of 0-3 years. it is these downstairs, baby rooms that have some of the most \"activity\" one particular incident occurred about a year ago, conveniently around Halloween!

   "description": "Charles M. Keller, principal from January 1985 - June 1992, learned of strange happenings when he arrived for duty - lights going off for no reason during the day and strange things at night.  Teachers working late or at night would have feelings that someone was watching them, strange rapping sounds, and one teacher saw an apparition of a man. Mr. Keller wrote a ghost story called, \"Jake, The Ghost\", as a Halloween story for the children, teachers, and staff in 1985.  The story brought forth more reports of strange behavior from the staff.  One teacher working late one evening heard scuffing footsteps coming down the hall toward her classroom. When she investigated she saw nothing but the steps were still coming toward her!  She was so scared she climbed out the window, ran across the street to one of the neighbors and called her husband for help!  It was not until the summer of 2006 Mr. Keller learned the identity of the ghost. He is a writer of children's poems and stories and wanted further research on his story of the ghost.  In September 1903 there was a Chinese race riot.  The local labor union for some reason decided to run all the Chinese people out of town.  During the riot a Chinese man by the name of Ping Ling was badly beaten and hit over the right eye with a hatchet.  He decided to walk out of town and leave the area.  He bled to death on the road. That road now is the same one that is between Silver Rim School and the Mormon LDS Church. Silver Rim School was not built until 1980. Where the ghost of Ping Ling was until that time is uncertain. Why he chose to take up residence of the school is another mystery. Mr. Keller is certain Ping Ling means no harm to the people in the building.  He is not seen or heard during the day when there are activities in the school. But at night he is quite active and curious. However, Mr. Keller made many trips back to the school at night, especially during the winter, to check security and the heating system. He never encountered Ping Ling on any of his trips. He could only surmise Ping Ling respected him.",

He walked past them, not looking to the right or left, or at them. They could not hear his footsteps as he walked by. It was very peculiar in those days for a stranger to be alone in the mountains at dark without a horse or supplies. He would have approached the fire to talk. But this person acted as though they weren't there. Charles M. Scribner ran a stage line between Battle and Encampment.

The original building was built on a graveyard. It is said a music teacher hung himself in newer north part. - January 2007 Additional information/Correction: The building was not built on a graveyard. What happened back in the late 1800's was that there were some vigilante killings because a gang had taken over Laramie. Some of the bodies were buried in the vicinity of the Civic Center. They were buried all over the area. The townspeople made sure to rebury the bodies elsewhere before building the School, which is now the Civic Center. There is no way the bodies are still there as there is a basement that has to be at least 10 feet below the surface. There were no known suicides in the school or civic center. A woman did die of cancer in the building back in the 1970's. There was a janitor that died in the hospital of cancer and another janitor that died in his apartment of a brain injury. A witness reports seeing shadows darting around. They have had a terrible experience of an electric door slamming furiously one night around 10pm. The power to the door was turned off at the time it occurred. They walked through some rose scented perfume one time that wouldn't move or dissipate. They have heard voices when no one was there & heard footsteps and running when no one was there. It is possible That some has to be residual haunting such as hearing a basketball game going on. also heard Indian drumming at night. Also working late and was standing next to the copy machine, which was turned off. It came on suddenly. They have had the door to their office open and heard someone come in, but when they looked, the door wasn't open and no one was there.

Members of tour groups often report hearing strange voices in cells, seeing people disappear around corners, and feeling hostile or tense presences. Employees have also reported apparitions and sounds. There was recently an investigation by a group of paranormal experts, but specifics were not revealed except in vague terms. There are several hotbeds of activity in the prison, including the showers, Death Row, the Gas Chamber, and the Hold (isolation area), and certain specific cells, including one filled with the artwork of an inmate. Only recently restored were the Chapel and women's facility, also suspected of paranormal activity. Public functions are now held in the prison, including bazaars and Halloween \"haunted house\" tours. During the bazaars, booths were set up on ground level, near the shower area. The shower area was always inexplicably cold, with a sense of malice. Many inmates were attacked in the shower area.
