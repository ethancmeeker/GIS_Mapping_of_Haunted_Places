# Overview

This is a GIS map of haunted locations across the landlocked southern states. Some locations are more haunted than others so I did some research into certain locations to see what may be really haunted places or if some may just use the word "haunted" to gain publicity and tourism. 

This was to get me more familiar with geography of places as well as using that knowledge I would gain from that into usable code. This was also to help me grasp Javascript a bit more because it is a sought after language in the job field. Another thing was just being able to do research on places that I really do enjoy learning about.
